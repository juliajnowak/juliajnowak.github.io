		<h1>How is looking at something like the Earth from above a fantasy?</h1>
		<p id="earth">
			<div id="shape">Looking at the Earth from above is not something anyone can really just wake up, go outside, and do.</div> It's not some readily accessible thing. At the minimum, we might experience that while in a window seat on an airplane, some not even getting a chance to even do that. As astonishing as a window plane can be, it's nothing compared to what I imagine astronauts feel when they reach space and see the Earth from their ship. The idea of looking down on Earth from somewhere like space is a fantasy to ordinary people, it's not something we will probably ever have the experience of doing, minus the very small amount of those who make it as an astronaut.

		<p id="fantasy">
			I agree that seeing earth from above is something only a few people can do. Although it is a fantasy, I think there are many technological advancements today that let people experience what professoanls can. Of course it's not the same but some people don't want "same", they are ok with experiencing their space fantasies from the comfort of earth's gravity. We can tie technology and fantasies together by refrencing time. Over time, people have been able to go into space and see earth from above. they have also created virtual worlds and games to feel what astronauts do.
